# Object dimensions from Images using OpenCV Java

This project finds the real object dimesions from images. Two methods are implemented - reference obvject mehtod and stereo method. Reference object method uses an object of known dimensions in the image to compute the real dimensions of other objects in the same image. Stereo method uses two images of the same scene with known camera orientations to determine the real dimensions of objects in the image.

Execution Steps:

1. Download the project.

2. Download OpenCV 3.2.0 from here and link it to the project.

3. Compile and Run the ExecuteMe.java class present in the path VirtualRuler_CV_Spring17\src\com\java\Test\ExecuteMe.java

Results:

1. Reference Object Method result 'ReferenceResults.JPG' can be found in the path VirtualRuler_CV_Spring17\Resources\Images\ReferenceResults.JPG

2. Stereo Object Method result can be found in the path VirtualRuler_CV_Spring17\Resources\Images\StereoResults.JPG
